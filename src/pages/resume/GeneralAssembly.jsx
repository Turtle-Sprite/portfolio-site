                <h3>Software Engineering Immersive</h3>
                <p>In the Software Engineering Immersive, I learned how to design and implement websites from the ground up. From modeling the data, to designing wireframes, and finally, connecting functionality with form. My projects challenged me to build websites that could be implemented to meet client needs. Such as implementing Stripe payments, user authorization, and designing databases that meet the needs of businesses. </p>
